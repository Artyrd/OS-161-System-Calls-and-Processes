# OS-161-System-Calls-and-Processes

Created the following system calls via kernel code: open, read, write, lseek, close, dup2.
This is to enable OS/161 to be capable of running processes from actual compiled programs.

A substantial part of this assignment was understanding how OS/161 works and determining what code is required to implement the required functionality.
A longer amount of time was spent browsing and digesting OS/161 code than actually writing and debugging my own code.
